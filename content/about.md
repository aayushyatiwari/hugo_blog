Hello. I am Aayushya Tiwari. I like to write, understand and sometimes explain.    
This is a place where I document what I learn - mostly tech and science, sometimes life.   
I am interested in machine learning, cs, math, science, philosophy, reading (sometimes), running, and music.    

**I hope to learn, and use whatever I have to make this a better world.**

Thanks for being here.

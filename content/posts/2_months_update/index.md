title: "Thoughts on AI; updates on essays"

If you didn't know, I recently started writing more. Published a new website.        Yes, the website you're reading this at.       
The reason was to get good at understanding and learning.       
With the coming of AI, writing code has never been easier. And to be honest, I don't think AI has any role in this. This was way before AI came.        
The main thing that drives the world imo is an **idea**. Ideas and implementations.         
Now the way we *implement* things have been changing since ages.        
The one example I like to think about is of the compilers and assembly programmers when C language came.        
Pretty sure all of them were in the same position developers today are.     
But that's another story. Implementations change, but the most thing that drives technology, sciences, math and all the important stuff, are, as i said, ideas.     
And to get better ideas, we don't just need intellect. No.      
We need *creativity*, we need people who can understand deeply. Who can **think**.      
And I don't use the word think in a lighter manner.     
Thinking was never easy.        
And in today's world, it's even harder.     
Which is why I started writing. Because believe me or not, writing is thinking.     
Every week I have this essay that I have to think about, learn, and write about.        
It's not merely about the act of writing.       

> Think deeply :)

It's about, forcing your brain to make neural connections and engage in the **act** of thinking.        
Honestly, I couldn't for the life of me understand [backprop](https://tiwariji.net/posts/backprop/). But trying to write the essay and implementing different neural nets without the pytorch's `loss.backward()` helped me understand it better.      
That, is exactly why I started writing. 

# So, what's the update?
I have been enjoying this. Two months since I have started writing, *officially*. And it is going well. I can, obviously, think better about anything that I am reading. Most importantly I understand, where there is a bug. There is a flaw. Not in the code, or the equations, but in *my* understanding.        

I have been writing more code than ever, I mean, debugging more than ever. :P       
Currently building an autograd engine and modifying the already written micrograd in cpp.       
Also, reading some research papers.     
Trying to learn about the intersection of AI and low-level stuff.       




Moving forward, I'd like to contribute to this small world more. Learn, produce more.       
Hopefully, you'd be watching! :)

Thanks for reading.
